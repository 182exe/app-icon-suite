# o7
my phone app icons. to use them, you can download the zip from the releases section. there is a file called info.txt which will help you.
if you want to request another one, you can make an issue on this repo or contact me any way you think is fine.

*it's named o7 because that's the first little emoticon that came to mind that would be allowed in a repo name*
